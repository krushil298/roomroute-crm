### ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION (1 item)

10. **⚠️ Leads-to-deals count** - Need example of what you want

## Do They Make Sense?

**YES!** ✅ Every change you requested is:
- Smart from a UX perspective
- Standard CRM best practice
- Solves real user pain points
- Technically sound

---

## Are They Executable?

**YES!** ✅ All changes are executable:

## What I Need From You

### 3 Quick Questions:

**1. Activity Count Conflict:**
You requested both:
- Dashboard: Show 10 recent activities ✅ (currently implemented)
- Recent activity: Only store 5 activities

Which do you prefer: **5 or 10?**

**2. 5-Day Auto-Delete:**
Should activities automatically delete after 5 days?
- **YES** = Clean dashboard, but lose history
- **NO** = Keep all activities forever

Your choice: **YES or NO?**

**3. Leads-to-Deals Count:**
Example: "Contact ABC has $10K potential value"
→ I create a deal for $10K in "Qualified" stage
→ Should contact ABC still count in "lead count"?

Your answer: **YES or NO?**
